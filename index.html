                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Rani Ki Vav is the oldest and the grandest stepwell in the state of Gujarat. It is situated at Patan and is believed to have been built during 1022 to 1063 AD. The construction was completed by the widowed queen Udayamati. She was the wife of King Bhimdev I, son of Mularaja, the founder of the Solanki dynasty of Anahilwada Pattan. It is a richly sculptured monument and a major tourist spot in Patan. The size of the Rani Ki Vav is so huge that the tourists appear to be ants climbing an anthill.</p>

                <p>A warm love story, which stands out from other stereotype lovestories of Bollywood. Probably one of the best performances from the leading duo, and an excellent and pacy direction from Imtiaz Ali, makes this a real treat of a movie.

                <p>When a film has such an overwhelming positive and pleasant title, can the contents be any less sunny? The good thing about Happy is that it doesn't let its name down.With a simple story and imaginative screenplay, the movie keeps you engrossed. The combination of enjoyable fun, good music and easy emotions make the film work. Director Karunakaran, who knows a thing or two about youthful romance stories, wrests the best out of his cast and crew. Allu Arjun, the sensational young star in the making, understands his responsibility and come out with a well-etched performance. His chemistry with Genelia is also attractive.</p>
